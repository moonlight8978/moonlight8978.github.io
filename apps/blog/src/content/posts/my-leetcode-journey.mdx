## Introduction

I've been learning competitive programming for a few months now, and I've been using LeetCode as my primary platform. I've learned a lot from it, but it also made me suffering a lot.

I've been thinking about writing a blog post about my journey, but I've never done it before. So I decided to write it here.

## My Journey

{getLeetCodeProblems().map((problem) => (
  <p>
    <a href={`/leetcode/${problem}`}>{problem}</a>
  </p>
))}
