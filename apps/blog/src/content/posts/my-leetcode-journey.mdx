## Why I Started LeetCode

For a long time in my software engineering career, I've been working on building applications, optimizing SQL statements, configuring CI/CD pipelines, and deploying Helm charts. I often used arrays, hash maps/sets for O(1) lookup, or tree BFS/DFS at most. Opportunities to use advanced data structures and algorithms were very rare.

Now, I'm a 28-year-old software engineer, and I want to look for a new job, but every interviewer asks me about finding the best time to buy and sell stocks, and finding reverse words for a Cloud/Kubernetes-based DevOps Engineer position. Haha, I was depressed.

I've been learning competitive programming for a few months now, and I've been using LeetCode as my primary platform. I've learned a lot from it, but it has also made me suffer a lot, haha.

## My Journey
